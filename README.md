# English Conjugation System

This program, written in 1988 for the Atari ST using the GFA BASIC language, conjugates English verbs, e. g. finds out that the 1st person singular present tense of "to go" is "I go", or that the 3rd personal plural conditional II of "to see" is "they would have seen". It was written to demonstrate that English, in contrast to more complex languages like German or Latin, has very simple conjugation rules that can be implemented in a simple algorithm, with very few special cases needing to be covered beside the plain list of irregular verbs.

## How To Run The Program

To run the program you need an Atari ST computer, or an emulator like Hatari or NoSTalgia. Copy all files from this repository onto a floppy or harddisk image, mount the image in the emulator, and double-click ECS.PRG in the GEM desktop.

Your emulator might allow you to mount a folder on your regular harddisk directly without having to make an image file. In Hatari, this is called  "GEMDOS drive".

## Files

* ECS.1ST: Documentation in 1st Word Plus format (in German).
* ECS.DOC: Brief introduction (in German).
* ECS.ECS: Irregular verbs database. Text file, first line is number of entries.
* ECS.LST: Source code in GFA BASIC.
* ECS.PRG: The executable.

Note: ECS.DOC is included in the original 1989 version for historical reasons. It offers you to receive printed documentation and latest version if you send 10 DM and a formatted floppy. For obvious reasons, this offer i‚s no longer valid.
